# Multiple Brother Devices: Multiple Vulnerabilities

## Overview
[Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/) conducted a zero-day research project into multifunction printers (MFP) from [Brother Industries, Ltd](https://global.brother/en). This research resulted in the discovery of eight new vulnerabilities. Some or all of these vulnerabilities have been identified as affecting 689 models across Brotherâ€™s range of printer, scanner, and label maker devices. Additionally, 46 printer models from FUJIFILM Business Innovation, 5 printer models from Ricoh, and 2 printer models from Toshiba Tec Corporation are also affected by some or all of these vulnerabilities. In total, 742 models across 4 vendors are affected.

A summary of the eight vulnerabilities is shown below:
